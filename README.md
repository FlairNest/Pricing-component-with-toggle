### What I learned

This week we performed this challenge. In it we used html, css and js. In the process of its implementation, 
we have improved our skills in programming, writing codes, styling and connecting js, which makes the site more interactive.

const mp = document.querySelectorAll(".priceannually");  -- The querySelectorAll() Document method returns a static NodeList containing all found document elements that match the specified selector.

switcher.addEventListener("click", function () {  -- The document.addEventListener() method attaches an event handler to the document.

b.classList.add("d-none");
b.classList.remove("d-none"); -- The classList property returns the class name(s) of an element, as a DOMTokenList object.

This property is useful to add, remove and toggle CSS classes on an element.

The classList property is read-only, however, you can modify it by using the add() and remove() methods.

### Continued development

In this project we used html5, css and js. Although the site is modeled, it still needs some additions and will continue to develop. 
You can add functions such as additional information by clicking on the "learn more" button.
